# R-vs-M-prediction
Rock vs Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether an object in sonar signals represents a rock or a mine. The dataset used contains features extracted from sonar signals, and logistic regression is employed as the classification algorithm.

## Features
- **Data Source:** The dataset comprises sonar signal features, with each sample labeled as either "R" (Rock) or "M" (Mine).

- **Algorithm:**
  - **Logistic Regression:** Logistic regression is utilized for binary classification. It models the probability that a given instance belongs to a particular class and makes predictions based on a threshold.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages can be installed using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

markdown
Copy code

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation:**
 - Ensure the dataset is in the correct format and includes the necessary features.
 - Perform any preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values or encoding categorical variables.

2. **Training:**
 - Run the `train_logistic_regression.py` script to train the logistic regression model on the prepared dataset.

3. **Prediction:**
 - Use the trained model to make predictions on new data by running the `predict.py` script.

## Files
- **sonar_data.csv:** Dataset containing sonar signal features and corresponding labels (R/M).
- **train_logistic_regression.py:** Script for training the logistic regression model.
- **predict.py:** Script for making predictions using the trained logistic regression model.
- **requirements.txt:** List of Python packages required for the project.

## Results
- Provide insights into the accuracy and performance of the logistic regression model.
- Include relevant evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) and possibly visualizations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the predictions.

## Future Work
- Discuss potential improvements or enhancements that can be made to the model.
- Consider experimenting with feature engineering, exploring other classification algorithms, or fine-tuning hyperparameters.
